# Slides (nico reski)

The purpose of this repository is to keep track and collect all kinds of slides and other material I prepared and presented over the years. All the material is publicly available for learning purposes, as well as for re-usage and inspiration. The repository content will always represent the latest versions (e.g. in case of reoccurring lectures).


## Repo organization
